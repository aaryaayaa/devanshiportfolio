          <p>
    
            I'm a second-year graphic design student at ISDI, where I’m exploring the vast world of creativity and design. My studies have given me the tools to express myself visually while helping me refine my eye for detail and passion for storytelling through art. Every project I undertake feels like a journey, where I get to merge meaning and aesthetics into something impactful.
        </p>

        <p>
  
          Beyond my academic life, I have a deep connection with horse riding, a sport that has been a significant part of my life. Over the years, I’ve advanced to a professional level, and it’s more than just a hobby; it’s a space where I truly feel free and in sync with nature. At home, I’m surrounded by my furry companions: a loyal dog and two playful cats who bring warmth and joy to my everyday life.
  
        </p>
  
        <p>
  
          When it comes to my personality, I strike a balance between introversion and extroversion. I enjoy meaningful conversations and connections but equally value my personal space. Some might describe me as reserved, while others see me as an ambient, someone who finds comfort in both social interactions and solitude.
  
        </p>
  
        <p>
            My spirituality is a core part of who I am, reflected in the three tattoos I proudly wear, each carrying its own deep and personal meaning. These tattoos are like visual affirmations of my beliefs and the journey I’m on. I also have a strong admiration for red hair: it’s bold, striking, and unapologetic, much like the energy I often channel in my presence. I know I can come across as intimidating at first glance, but those who know me understand there’s more to me than meets the eye.

        </p>
  
        <p>
  
          My life is a blend of creativity, self-discovery, and balance. Whether I’m working on a design project, riding a horse, or simply enjoying quiet moments with my pets, I strive to infuse intention and depth into everything I do.
